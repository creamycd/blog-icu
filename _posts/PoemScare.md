# Poem:Scare

â€‹													

Scary?
Not Scared.

What scary?
Never scary.
FIIGHT, FIGHT,FIGHT!

Towards, 
towards regardless everything.
Meaningless,
boycott the meanless.

The Beast continued its studies with renewed *Focus*,
building great *Reference* works and contemplating new *Realities*.
The Beast brought forth its followers and acolytes
to create a renewed smaller form of itself and, 
through *Mischievous* means,
sent it out across the world.

Could praying, only praying beat the enemies?
No.
Then let us act now,
when the God is asleep.
