# Poem:Offensive is to Secure

​													

In the realm of battles, where conflicts arise,
The quieter you become, the stronger your guise.
Amidst the strategies, the cunning and the might,
A defender’s wisdom shines in the stillness of night.

The attacker’s footsteps, they echo loud and clear,
But the defender listens, with an attentive ear.
In the silence, vulnerabilities are revealed,
A chance to fortify, to shield and to wield.

The quieter you become, the more you can perceive,
The subtleties of attack, the webs they weave.
In the depths of observation, patterns emerge,
A defender’s insight, a tactical surge.

With every hushed breath, a plan takes shape,
Anticipating moves, the attacker’s landscape.
The defender’s mind, a fortress of defense,
Analyzing, strategizing, with utmost prudence.

In the realm of battles, where chaos ensues,
The defender’s calmness, a weapon to use.
For in the stillness, clarity is found,
A shield against threats, unyielding and profound.

So let the silence guide you, in the realm of strife,
Unveiling the attacker’s intentions, rife.
The quieter you become, the stronger your stance,
A defender’s vigilance, a shield in advance.

Embrace the quietude, let it be your guide,
As you navigate the currents, side by side.
For in the realm of battles, where dangers draw near,
The whispers of wisdom, the defender shall hear.
